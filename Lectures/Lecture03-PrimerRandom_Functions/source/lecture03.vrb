\frametitle{Experiment with runtime for universal function}
Now, we will use broadcasting to compute the exponential of the identity matrix.

Run the following code in your Jupyter notebook.

\begin{codeblock}

\begin{python}
id_matrix = np.eye(1000)
exp_matrix = np.zeros((1000, 1000))
start = time.time()
exp_matrix = np.exp(id_matrix)
end = time.time()
print(f"Seconds taken: {end-start}.")
\end{python}

\end{codeblock}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[] Again, the output is the number of seconds of runtime. For this approach with \ttt{np.exp()}, my computer took around 0.0045 seconds. That is over 100 times faster than writing the loop!
\end{itemize}
