### Getting started with Python and Jupyter
As a file, each Jupyter notebook has the file extension `.ipynb` (short for <span style="color:blue;">IPy</span>thon <span style="color:blue;">N</span>ote<span style="color:blue;">b</span>ook). The assigned notebooks for class will be found on the course website.

Editing and running a Jupyter notebook can be done in a number of ways. Here are two ways.
1. Working with Jupyter notebooks through Google's Colaboratory (Colab). 
    * If you have not used Google Colab before, then go to [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) in your web browser. When prompted where to create your first notebook, select Google Drive. After this, you may create, edit, run, and save Jupyter notebooks from your favorite folder in Google Drive.
    * If you have used Google Colab before then you may simply place the `.ipynb` file in your Google Drive -- in your favorite folder. Click on the filename to open the notebook and begin working. (Depending on your settings, you might need to right-click and tell Google Drive to "open with" Colab.)
2. Installing and running `python` and `jupyter` on your own computer: there is a wealth of possibilities for this; which is best for you depends on your personal preferences and operating system. In any event, you will probably want to download an IDE.
    * A solid development environment (which is useful for many different coding needs, and also makes it easy to set up `python` and `jupyter`) is Visual Studio. It is not open source, but is free for individual or "small enterprise" use.
    * Another popular option is to install Anaconda (in addition to Python). It has been several years since I used Anaconda for writing IPython notebooks. Historically, there were a few challenges in using Python 3 with it -- particularly on Windows, for a few Python libraries.
