# Source Files for Example Lecture
The slides for class lessons are generated with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), using the [Beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer) documentclass. 

In most Lecture folders, I only include the generated PDF for that lecture (with no "pauses"). This folder contains (post-compilation) source files for the slides `lecture01bslides.pdf`.
