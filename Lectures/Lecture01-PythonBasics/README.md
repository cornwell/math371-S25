# Files for Lecture
Slides for Lecture 01 (with no "pauses") and first Jupyter notebook.

The slides for class lessons are generated with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), using the [Beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer) documentclass. The folder 'source' contains (post-compilation) source files for the slides `lecture01_slides.pdf` and `lecture01b_slides.pdf`.
