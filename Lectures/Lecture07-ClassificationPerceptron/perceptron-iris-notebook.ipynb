    "> The Iris data set can also be obtained by using the Python package Scikit-learn. You need this package installed first; once you have done that, you may simply put in the command: `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`. This returns a dictionary object (technically, a \"bunch\"). From that \"bunch\", the keys 'data', and 'target', will give you the x vectors in $\\mathbb R^4$, and the y labels, respectively."
