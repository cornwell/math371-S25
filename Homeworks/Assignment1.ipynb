    "2. Write a custom Python function. The function should take an array of $x$ values as its argument and it returns a set of $y$ values \"with noise\" for the chi-squared function $y = \\frac{1}{4}x e^{-x/2}$. The noise should be put in by adding to $y$ a value of a mean-zero, normally distributed random variable with a small standard deviation (something close to $1/100$, say). After defining your custom function in your session, produce a plot of the chi-squared function on the interval $[0,5]$, together with a scatter plot of 200 noisy $(x,y)$ pairs.\n",
