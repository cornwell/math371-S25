# Spr 2025, Final Project

## Overview
The final project will give you an opportunity to work with other students in the class in order to analyze a real-world data set by using one of the machine learning models that we have discussed briefly in class. While projects are submitted on an individual basis and, ultimately, each student is responsible for the content in their project, it is hoped that a group of other students working with you on the same model and same data set will provide opportunities for learning from each other, as well as being able to perform a deeper analysis of the data that you have.

You may choose one of the following types of machine learning models. Depending on which you choose, and your data, the goals of your project may vary.

1. Support Vector Machine. 
> Model improvement: Using kernel methods
2. Neural network &ndash; a _fully-connected, feedforward_ neural network.
3. Decision tree.
> Model improvment: Boosted decision tree, using AdaBoost.
4. Clustering, comparing K-means methods versus DBSCAN.

## Stages of the Project
1. Select one of the types of machine learning models above, and a type of machine learning task &ndash; regression task, classification task, or unsupervised (clustering) project. (**By April 15, or before**)
2. Select a data set, appropriate for your chosen task, from the UCI library of data sets (linked below). After selecting the data, make an appointment with Dr. Cornwell to discuss your selected project and data. At that meeting, we will discuss specific goals for analyzing the data (including choices that will be needed in the design stage), and any hypothesis that you may have about the data. (**Ideally, appointments should be during the week of April 21**)
3. After obtaining some initial analysis results, a Check-in with Dr. Cornwell about your progress.(**Between May 1 and May 7**)
4. A final write-up, described below. (**Due by Thursday May 15 at 2:30 pm**)


## Data Set Selection
* Unless it has been first discussed with me, search for your data set from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/).

## Write-up and Project Submissions
Each student will turn in a final project, which will include both a report/write-up and code (in a Jupyter notebook). The write-up should be a PDF file, may include figures if relevant, and may directly refer to parts of the Jupyter notebook.

The write-up should include: 
* a description of the data &ndash; including information about the variables and any initial observations about the data set; 
* a discussion of the machine learning model being used for the analysis task;
    * what are the parameters of the model, and how does the model work (i.e., how does it _predict_ labels on new data)? 
    * how did your group train the model (discuss the procedure used to optimize the parameters) on the training data? what choices were made and why, what methods were used to avoid overfitting?
* results of the model's performance on test data, with appropriate visuals; 
* a summary analysis including results and the insights gained: 
    * if there were issues with accuracy, what might be the source of those issues? 
    * what might be changed in a future analysis to resolve those issues? 
    * is there a "take-away" insight about the data itself and the conclusions that you can draw from what you obtained?

## Deadline: Thursday, May 15 at 2:30 pm.

## Evaluation Criteria
Projects will be assessed based on the following.
1. The data being thoroughly explored and understood.
2. Proper implementation, training, and use of your machine learning model. This includes appropriate separation between training and test data, and the use of techniques to avoid using too many parameters or overfitting the data.
3. Clarity and organization of included Jupyter notebooks, including appropriate comments within the code.
4. Clarity and justification for the summary analysis.

A grading rubric will be made available in Blackboard.
